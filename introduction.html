					<p>	My name is Robin Mitchell-Haddad. I came to teaching in rather a roundabout way. I had been working in sales and was a Director of Outside Sales for Murad Inc. when I discovered I was pregnant with my first child. After my daughter was born, I decided to leave my position and be a stay-at-home mom.</p>
					<p>	When my daughter was in first grade, her teacher asked parents if anyone could volunteer inside the classroom and help out with the new reading program. The program included centers and it was difficult for one teacher to oversee 5 centers and keep the little ones engaged, and on track at all times. I said I could help and started to volunteer. I spent most of my time in the oral reading center listening and guiding students through their stories. I found myself enjoying this much more than I ever thought possible and not really understanding why. Upon reflection, I realized that in my sales career, of 11 plus years, a large percentage of my responsibilities revolved around teaching. I taught product knowledge to my sales team and to their clients. I taught job and sales training to my staff. I hosted consumer nights in our clients’ establishments. This h introduce our products to the public and increase sales of our products for both our clients and for our company. Without knowing it, I was a teacher!</p>
					<p>	After volunteering one day, I came home and told my husband about my experiences and raved about my daughter’s teacher. I than proceeded to say, “However, if I was the teacher, and this was my classroom I would do things just a little differently.” To which he replied, “Then why don’t you become a teacher.” I pondered that for a while, and then proceeded to look into what it would take to make that happen, and “Voila” here I am. </p>
					<p>	I try not to just teach, but to inspire! I love watching the “A-Ha!” light go on. I want my students to do more than just learn, I want them to develop a lifelong passion for learning. I have experience teaching K-4, and am currently teaching Middle School for California Virtual Academies. As much as I love the hugs from the little ones, I must say I am really enjoying my middle schoolers, especially my 8th graders. I am a bit of a smart aleck myself with a very east coast sense of humor and the older students grasp my humor, and a good time is had by all. I find humor is a great way to engage students and build those, all so important, bonds that make learning possible. Students do not learn from those they do not like or respect.</p>
